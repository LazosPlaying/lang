# The "lang" repo


This repo is used for saving scripts / code parts that are being used often *(at least from me?)*

Feel free to use any code you find in this repository - you are allowed to redistribute it, but you are required to link it to this source.
You are also allowed to use the code in any paid projects, but not allowed to sell the code you find here itself, as is without any additions or modifications.
The code is provided "as is".

If you know how to improve any part of the code you find, you are welcome to contribute.
